# Matplotlib_Homework

I had difficulties with my Github not working with my command line. 
Bowen was able to help me but it made it look like I submitted the homework super late and deleted the Readme where I posted the observable trends. I had initially just uploaded it from the website. 

It uploaded everything in the folder. I did the Pyber exercise. 

Urban Pyber rides are cheap and frequent, comprising 68.4% of all rides. Numerous drivers and larger populations help 
Suburban rides make up a surprising proportion of Pyber total fares (33%) even though they're only 26% of total rides. Urban Pyber total fares are 48% of total fares, even though they're 68% of total rides.
Because rural rides are longer distances, they make up 18% of fares, even though they're only 5% of total rides.
